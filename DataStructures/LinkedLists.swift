    /*
     A linked list is a sequential structure that consists of a sequence
     of items in linear order which are linked to each other. Hence, you
     have to access data sequentially and random access is not possible.
     Linked lists provide a simple and flexible representation of dynamic sets.
     
     - Elements in a linked list are known as nodes.
     - Each node contains a key and a pointer to its successor node, known as next.
     - The attribute named head points to the first element of the linked list.
     - The last element of the linked list is known as the tail.
